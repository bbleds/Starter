    <p>
      Our vision is to be a church of spirit-filled people, standing ready
      to serve our community and<br>lead others to know the fullness of the gospel
      of Jesus Christ. We want to guide others on their<br>journey to meeting God,
      whatever path of life they may be following. We want to continue<br>planting
      churches around our town and the Middle Tennessee area and see our
      communities<br>transformed by the power of Christ and the shared love of Him
      and His church.

    <p>
      At TPOM, we believe whole-heartedly that every person has a responsibility
      to the Kingdom of<br>God. That duty manifests itself differently for
      everyone and that's the beautiful thing about<br>ministry: it's all unique
      and it's all important! Whether helping with our children's classes or<br>
      singing with a worship team in our main services, TPOM believes in the
      power of individuals<br>equipped in ministry and we love to see the fruit
      of this dedication.
